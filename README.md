# Introduction 

### Hello, I am Rakshita Mathur. Welcome to My lil-Hub!

I am a data scientist with a background in computer science. I am currently a 3rd-year Computer Science student at uOttawa. My areas of expertise include machine learning, data visualization, and deep leaning. 

## Projects

Here are a few of the projects I have completed:

- **Information Retrieval system**: Developed an Information Retrieval system in Python using NLTK and Vector Space Model. Tokenized and removed stop words from 322 documents and created an inverted index with a vocabulary of 450,000 words. Utilized the TF-IDF weighting scheme and cosine similarity to rank the documents on 50 test queries, resulting in a highly effective and efficient information retrieval system.

- **RANSAC & DBSCAN Algorithm**: Implemented RANSAC algorithm in Java for robust model fitting to detect and remove outliers in 3D points data. Also implemented DBSCAN algorithm in Java for clustering GPS coordinates into regions of high activity. Evaluated the performance of both algorithms, developed unit tests, and documented the code for reuse. Developed skills in computer vision and object-oriented programming.

- **Decision Tree**:  Designed and implemented a Decision Tree in Java using Shannon's Logarithmic Entropy to analyze a dataset in a CSV file and generate a decision tree. 

## Learning Goals

I am currently working on improving my skills in natural language processing and deep learning. I am also interested in learning more about AI

## Collaboration

I am always looking for opportunities to collaborate with other data scientists and researchers.
