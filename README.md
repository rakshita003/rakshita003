# Welcome to My GitHub Profile

Hello and welcome to my little corner of GitHub. I'm Rakshita Mathur, a passionate data scientist with a background in computer science. Currently, I'm a 4th-year Computer Science student at the University of Ottawa. My areas of expertise include machine learning, data visualization, and deep learning.

## Projects

Here are a few of the projects I've completed:

### Information Retrieval System

[![GitHub Repo](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/rakshita003/CSI4107-Information-Retrieval-and-the-Internet?style=flat&logo=github)](https://github.com/rakshita003/CSI4107-Information-Retrieval-and-the-Internet)

Developed an Information Retrieval system in Python using NLTK and Vector Space Model. Tokenized and removed stop words from 322 documents and created an inverted index with a vocabulary of 450,000 words. Utilized the TF-IDF weighting scheme and cosine similarity to rank the documents on 50 test queries, resulting in a highly effective and efficient information retrieval system.

### DBSCAN Algorithm

Implemented DBSCAN algorithm in Java for clustering GPS coordinates into regions of high activity. Evaluated the performance of both algorithms, developed unit tests, and documented the code for reuse. Developed skills in computer vision and object-oriented programming.

### Decision Tree

[![GitHub Repo](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/rakshita003/Decision-Tree?style=flat&logo=github)](https://github.com/rakshita003/Decision-Tree)

Designed and implemented a Decision Tree in Java using Shannon's Logarithmic Entropy to analyze a dataset in a CSV file and generate a decision tree.

... and many more.

## Learning Goals

I'm constantly working to expand my knowledge and skills in natural language processing and deep learning. I'm enthusiastic about the field of AI and strive to keep up with the latest developments.
